## Plex plug-in that plays live streams using acestream engine ##

### Introduction ###
A [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/downloads) plug-in that scrapes reddit's pages looking for acestream links and then populate a list understandable by plex.

### Supported subreddits ###
* boxingstreams
* nbastreams
* nflstreams
* MMAStreams
* motorsportsstreams
* soccerstreams_other

### Requirements ###
In order to stream content you need acestream engine on the same host listening on port 6878, I personally start the engine with options "--log-stdout --client-console"
